# Image-Caption-Generator
This file contains an ML model which can generate caption for images you upload.  I have used streamlit to make an output.

This model used the vit-gpt2-image-captioning model which is available at Hugging face repository (https://huggingface.co/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning)

The main file is the file which contains the image processing and model running where the run file contains the streamlit and its execution.
